# iOS Security Research Notes

This repository contains structured notes and methodologies I use while studying iOS security.
The focus areas align with my ongoing research and with my Apple SRD application.

## üìå Focus Areas
- **Private Cloud Compute (PCC)**  
  Exploring potential attack surfaces, integrity verification, and attestation flows.

- **Beta Software Regressions**  
  Tracking and testing new iOS beta builds for regressions, newly introduced bugs, or 
  reappearing vulnerability classes.

- **Lockdown Mode**  
  Evaluating bypass opportunities for the restrictions enforced by Lockdown Mode, such as 
  messaging parsers, WebKit hardening, and external interface handling.
